# Assignment vs Equality Operators Exercise
## Objective
Learn the difference between the assignment operator (=) and the equality operator (==) in Java.

## Instructions
1. **Step 1: Declare Variables with Specific Values**
    - Declare an integer variable named `num1` and assign it the value 10.
    - Declare an integer variable named `num2` and assign it the value 10.

2. **Step 2: Compare Using the Equality Operator (==)**
    - Compare `num1` and `num2` using the equality operator (==).
    - Expected output: The comparison (num1 == num2) should evaluate to true.

3. **Step 3: Use the Assignment Operator (=) to Change a Value**
    - Use the assignment operator to assign a new value to `num1` (for example, change `num1` to 20).
    - Note: The single equal sign (=) is used for assignment, not for comparison.

4. **Step 4: Compare Again Using the Equality Operator (==)**
    - Compare `num1` and `num2` again using (==).
    - Expected output: The comparison (num1 == num2) should now evaluate to false since `num1` has changed.

5. **Step 5: Print the Comparison Results**
    - Print the results of both comparisons to see the effect of using assignment versus equality operators.

## Expected Output
```
true
false
```

## Tips
- **Assignment Operator (=):** Used to assign a value to a variable.
- **Equality Operator (==):** Used to compare two values for equality.
- Remember to print the boolean result of each comparison to verify the output.

## Additional Information
- This exercise demonstrates that using the assignment operator does not compare valuesâ€”it only assigns a new value to a variable.
- The equality operator checks if two variables have the same value and returns a boolean result.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure that the variables are declared with the correct values.
- Check that you use the correct operator for each operation: "=" for assignment and "==" for comparison.
- Verify that the expected outputs match your test cases.
