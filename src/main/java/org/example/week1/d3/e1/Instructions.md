# Printing a Message on the Console

## Objective
Learn how to print a simple message on the console using Java.

## Instructions

1. **Print a Message**
   - Inside the existing `main` method, use `System.out.println` to print the message "Hello, World!" to the console.
     ```java
     System.out.println("Hello, World!");
     ```

2. **Run Your Program**
   - Execute your program to see the output on the console.

## Expected Output
```
Hello, World!
```

## Tips
- Use `System.out.println` to display text on the console.
- Enclose the message in double quotes.

## Additional Information
- **System.out.println**: This command prints the specified text and then moves the cursor to a new line.
- **Console Output**: This is where your program's printed messages appear.

## Troubleshooting
- If nothing is printed, verify that the print statement is placed inside the `main` method.
- Ensure that the text is correctly enclosed in double quotes to avoid syntax errors.

By following these steps, you'll understand the basics of printing output in Java. Happy coding!
