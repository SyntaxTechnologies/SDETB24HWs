# Printing Two Messages on the Console

## Objective
Learn how to print multiple messages on separate lines in the console using Java.

## Instructions

1. **Print Two Messages**
    - Inside the existing `main` method, use `System.out.println` to print the message "Hello, World!" on the first line.
    - Then, use another `System.out.println` to print the message "Welcome to Java!" on the second line.
      ```java
      System.out.println("Hello, World!");
      System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
      ```

2. **Run Your Program**
    - Execute your program to see the output on the console.

## Expected Output
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to Java!
```

## Tips
- Use `System.out.println` to print each message on a separate line.
- Make sure that you have two separate print statements.
- Double-check that each message is enclosed in double quotes.

## Additional Information
- **System.out.println**: This method prints the specified text to the console and moves the cursor to the next line.
- **Multiple Print Statements**: You can print multiple lines by calling `System.out.println` for each line.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program prints only one message, verify that you have two separate `System.out.println` statements.
- Check for typos or missing quotation marks.

By following these steps, you'll understand how to print multiple lines of output in Java. Happy coding!
