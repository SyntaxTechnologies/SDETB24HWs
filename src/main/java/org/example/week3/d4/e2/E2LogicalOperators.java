// Personal Budgeting Helper - Step-by-Step Guide

// Step 1: Create a Scanner object.

// Step 2: Capture Monthly Expenses.
//   - Ask the user for their monthly rent expense and store it in a variable 'rentExpense'.
//   - Ask for the monthly food expense and store it in 'foodExpense'.
//   - Ask for the monthly transportation expense and store it in 'transportationExpense'.
//   - Ask for the monthly entertainment expense and store it in 'entertainmentExpense'.
//
// Step 3: Analyze Expenses Using Logical &&.
//   - Use an if-else statement with the && operator to compare expenses.
//   - If rentExpense is greater than foodExpense AND transportationExpense is greater than entertainmentExpense:
//       - Print: "You are prioritizing essentials well."
//   - Else:
//       - Print: "You need to rethink your spending priorities."
//
// Reminder:
//   - Write your code step by step, and test it to see that the output matches the expected results.
